## Setup

If you're getting a 404 error when you try to sign in to via GitHub, then you need to set your ENV['GITHUB_KEY'] and ENV['GITHUB_SECRET'] variables in .env

* Go to your GitHub & login
* Go to 'Account Settings'
* Go to 'Applications'
* Register a new application. Once created, your `id` and `secret_id` will be shown.
